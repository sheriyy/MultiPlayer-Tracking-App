# MultiPlayer-Tracking-App
 
Multiplayer Tracking App that uses the Google Video Intelligence API to detect and capture frames when F1 players appear in a video. These frames are then processed using the Vision API to identify and extract logos from the players' jerseys. The app maps each F1 player to their respective sponsor logos and displays them in a user-friendly UI. This solution combines real-time video analysis with logo recognition to deliver dynamic sports insights. 

Any futher recommendation is welcome !
